      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of general bugfixing in Godot lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the engine in one way or another for quite a few years now and contributing to open source projects is always very rewarding.</description>

      <description>I wrote Octo to teach myself emulator programming. I&amp;rsquo;m not very sure it was very successful really, it&amp;rsquo;s and extremely simple system and very, very easy to emulate.</description>

      <description>Sensar Description: This was a very interesting project for rehabilitation of patients with neuro-motor problems. It was a suite of minigames, all of them using the Kinect camera to detect gestures trained with machine learning techniques.
The main challenge was creating a system that would give accurate detection but at the same time allow to be configured lenient enough to account for each patient capabilities.
The system included user account support and full activity logging, intended to be shared with the medical staff.</description>

      <description>AR Viewer Description: This was an interesting augmented reality project that, unfortunately, was never released. The basic idea was that cable technicians usually have trouble identifying what is what when dealing with crowded equipment and this project was aimed to provide a clean and advanced solution.
Several augmented reality &amp;ldquo;data layers&amp;rdquo; would give the technician information about the device itself, about each customer and real time data of the device performance and issues.</description>

      <description>And just like this, I start a new website (yet) again. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write a little bit about my personal projects, my experiences and anything that might come to mind.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty barebones at the moment, but you have to start somewhere right? I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to keep adding content regularly.
Enjoy your stay :)</description>
