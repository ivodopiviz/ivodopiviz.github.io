      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of general bugfixing in Godot lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the engine in one way or another for quite a few years now and contributing to open source projects is always very rewarding.</description>

      <description>I wrote Octo to teach myself emulator programming. I&amp;rsquo;m not very sure it was very successful really, it&amp;rsquo;s and extremely simple system and very, very easy to emulate.</description>

      <description>AAA: Heroes del Ring Description: The PSP adaptation of a game released for Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t directly involved in the development of the game itself but on the actual port of the Torque 3D engine to the PSP platform.
It was an extremely difficult project that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work out, but it&amp;rsquo;s to this day one of the biggest learning experiences of my professional career.</description>
