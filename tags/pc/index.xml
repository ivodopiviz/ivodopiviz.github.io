      <description>Sensar Description: This was a very interesting project for rehabilitation of patients with neuro-motor problems. It was a suite of minigames, all of them using the Kinect camera to detect gestures trained with machine learning techniques.
The main challenge was creating a system that would give accurate detection but at the same time allow to be configured lenient enough to account for each patient capabilities.
The system included user account support and full activity logging, intended to be shared with the medical staff.</description>

      <description>Atmosphir Description: A very interesting project mix of platformer and level editor, made for the now defunct Minor Studios. The game was made with a very early version of what would eventually become Godot Engine and used Lua for scripting. Players could share their creations and challenge each map to set the fastest times.
This project would then move onto be developed by Minor Studios itself, getting ported to Unity and expanded significantly, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved anymore by that stage.</description>
